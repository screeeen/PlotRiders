  `You shouldn't come to this championship. You shouldn't even be reading this invitation. Because, why? You really shouldn't celebrate the summer. You shouldn't travel. Because it doesn't make sense to travel. You shouldn't come to Vigo. You shouldn't come to the best place in the world to spend August. Where the heat is there, in your skin, but it doesn't overwhelm you. Where the breeze is the best Atlantic breeze in the world. Guaranteed, 100% approved, 100% by the Marisquino Foundation Committee. The Marisquino Foundation has been experimenting with marine breezes for 25 years. And it has been meticulously filtering the marine breeze. And how it filters, how it affects the tricks on the track. I don't think you should come either. Because, well, the skatepark is nothing. It's a skatepark that you can skate anywhere. I'm sure that in your city there is a skatepark built exclusively with an exclusive design. To be able to skate in front of the Atlantic. The Bay of Vigo is a unique location in the world. Where there is a river, which is a unique geological phenomenon in the world. With spectacular views. That's nothing interesting. So we think you shouldn't come to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marisquino. Where a lot of the best skaters in the world come together. They have some impressive sessions. We think you shouldn't come and try. We think you shouldn't come and try to win the Marisquino. And crown yourself as the champion of the 25th edition. We think you should stay at home. Maybe playing Tony Hawk. And imagining how good it would be to be in Vigo. Taking in the sun. Having fantastic sessions. In the best sunset of the Atlantic. And having crazy and fun nights with the best community in the world. And one of the best places to celebrate the summer. Apart from the competition. World Cup competition. With some semi-finals that are a heart attack. With the best music you can find in a championship. The maximum intensity. And the peak of the summer. If we think this is not as relevant as to come.`;
